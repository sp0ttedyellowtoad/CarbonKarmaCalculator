      <h1> Small Lifestyle Changes</h1>  
      <h2> Big Global Impact</h2>

      <h3> Transportation </h3>
      <br>
      <p>The easiest was to lower your GHG emissions in the transportation sector would be to cycle or walk to places. But in our car depenendent society, this can be vary difficult to do. 
        Realistically, the best option is to <span class="bolded">carpool</span>. Carpooling to work and group events can be an amazing way to connect with others and reduce your carbon footprint! 
        If Ubers and Lyfts are more your speed, try out their respective 'shared rides' features. Electric cars can be a good alternative, but remember<span class="bolded">having an electric car does not mean you do not emitt GHG during travel!</span> 
       Transportation, like many of the other sectors we have listed, are very dependent on where you live and the resources avaliable to you, so don't beat yourself up too much! </p>
      <br><br>
      <h3> Household Energy Consumption </h3>
      <br>
      <p>I know people say solar panels are ugly! But consider the positive environmental impact. According to the <a href="https://www.cooleffect.org/solar-carbon-footprint">CoolEffect</a></li>, "The solar panel's carbon footprint is roughly 20 times less than the carbon output of coal-powered electricity sources."
       Adding solar panels to your house can also give you a relieving reduction in your electricity bill. Out of all of the ways to reduce household enery consumption. This is the one that the least 'gimicky'. But if you are not moved to put a panel the roof of your home here are some other suggestions.</p>
       <br>
       <ol>
        <li> Replace 30 incandescent light bulbs with LED lamps, which use about 85 percent less energy. </li>
        <li> Set thermostats 2°F lower in winter and 2°F higher in summer. Heating and cooling account for half of all home energy use. </li>
        <li> Recycle at least half of your household waste. </li>
        <li> Plant native plants in the garden. </li>
        <li> Install a smart thermostat. </li>
       </ol>

      <br><br>
      <h3> Online Consumption </h3>
      <br>
      <p>I get it! Two-day shipping is very tempting! But if you are consistently overnighting 8+ packages a month, you might want to consider other avenues to getting your items (and better time management skills). I know we fill like we <em>have</em> to
        execise the fullextent of your prime membership, but don't be afraid to tell Jeffrey no. Consider shopping at local markets for unique pieces that often come at a lower cost. Remember: the closer your product was made/grown to your house, the lower the (negative) environmental impact!</p>
      <br><br>
